<h3>Los Angeles Popular Landmarks </p>

<h4>DisneyLand </h4>
<!-- https://www.expedia.com/Disneyland-Park.d6143668.Destination-Travel-Guides -->
<img src="travel_disneyland.jpg" alt= "Disney Land" style = "width:20%;">
<div>DineyLand is a fun theme park for families to go and have fun. DisneyLand has been open since 1955. The cost for tickets at DisneyLand varies by date.
  The cost for tickets for 2 days $105.00, 3 days $93.34, 4 days $76.25 and 5 days $64.00.The park hours is 8AM-12AM. The more days you stay the less the tickets cost. But DisneyLand gets
  tiring the 2nd day for most adults. Thats why most adults pay for the 2 days, and do something else while they in Califorina, because theres more theme
  parks than DisneyLand. You will learn more about the other parks in my next landmark.Also if your kid is under the age of 3 years old they dont need a ticket.
  But rememeber DisneyLand is not a cheap place to vist, so make sure you have your money together before you go.</div>

<h4>Universal Studios Hollywood </h4>
  <!-- https://www.westjet.com/fr-ca/reserver-voyage/guide-destinations/decouvrir/orlando/universal-studios-florida/a226290 -->
<img src="travel_universal_studios.jpg" alt= "Universal Studios" style = "width:20%;">
<div> Universal Studios Hollywood is another theme park in Los Angeles. So if you get tired of DisneyLand bring your kid to Unverisal Studios Hollywood.
   Everybody thinks its like Universal in Flordia but its not. In my opinion the one in California is more fun for all ages than the one in Flordia.
   Its something for everybody to do. For Universal Studios Hollywood you buy a go card you will save 50%. General addminsion $109-$124, Universal
   Express $179-$249, VIP Experience $349, and 2 day general addminsion $139-$159 you can learn more about it on https://store.universalstudioshollywood.com/PurchaseTickets.aspx.
   Make sure you check the calander to see if they have aviable tickets on the day or days you decide to go.

<h4>The Los Angeles Theatre </h4>
<!-- https://urbanmatter.com/chicago/the-top-10-theaters-in-chicago/ -->
<img src="travel_los_angeles_theater.jpg" alt= "Los Angeles Theater" style = "width:20%;">
<div> The Los Angeles Theatre its not like a regular theatre. If you ever been to the Fox in Atlanta its just like that but better. The theatre has 2,000
          seats, its a historic movie palace. Its located in downtown Los Angeles. They basically show plays. Its something that kids and adults will like.
          You will see a lot of famous actors and actress in the crowd.

<h3>Las Vegas Popular Landmarks </h3>

<h4>Las Vegas Strip </h4>
<!-- https://www.expedia.com/Las-Vegas-Strip.d800045.Destination-Travel-Guides -->
<img src="travel_las_vegas_strip.jpg" alt= "The Strip" style = "width:20%;">
   <div>Las Vegas strip is so big its full of different shops and hotel all down the strip. I think the strip is the best part of Vegas because I love
     shopping, if you like to gamble Vegas is the best place for you, every hotel has a casino. Its always hot in Vegas so if you decide to bring your
     kids they can go to the pool. But I wouldnt recommend for you to bring your kids. Its a place for teens and adults. Also if you like me and love
     shopping the malls on the strip doesnt close til 11 at night. You can shop all day and night. Women love the strip just because of the shops. The
     strip has everything.

<h4>Old Vegas </h4>
<div> Old Vegas is not on the strip its downtown of Vegas. So if you live on the strip its like a 20 min drive, but its worth it. When
       you get to downtown Vegas you see all kind of people. Its always pack. Theres a zip line that you can get on you see everything
       when you on there. I'm scared of heights so I wouldnt do it but if you not scared of heights you would enjoy it. There's alot of entertainment
       in downtown Vegas. Its also free to walk around downtown Vegas, you have a few shops down there but everything in the stores have Vegas on it.
       You also have resturants to eat at if you get hungry. Its best to go at night time its more fun to me.

<h3>Toronto Popular Landmarks </h3>

<h4>Toronto Island </h4>
<!-- https://www.cantechletter.com/2012/07/selectcore-teams-up-with-city-of-toronto-on-prepaid-mastercard-deal/toronto-cn-tower/ -->
<img src="travel_toronto_island.jpg" alt= "Toronto Island" style = "width:20%;">
<div> Toronto Island is not like a normal island, when people think of islands they think of beaches or beautiful blue oceans. The islands are home to parkland,
           the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, several yacht clubs, Centreville Amusement Park,  and Hanlan's Beach. The island community is considered to be the largest
            urban car-free community in North America, although some service vehicles are permitted. You can ride a bike around on the island. I know Its
           always cold in Toronto, but people still go to the island even when its snowing.

<h4>CN Tower </h4>

<img src="travel_cn_tower.jpg" alt= "CN Tower" style = "width:20%;">
<div> The CN Tower used the be the biggest tower in the world, until 2009 being overtaken by Burj Khalifa and Canton tower. The hours of the Tower
           is 8:30AM-11PM. The cool things you can do in the tower is edge walk, shop, have a tour around the whole tower and there are resturants inside.
           You can pay for 4 differnet tikets. Also kids under the age of 3 years old are not allowed into the tower. Its for your child safety. Have fun
           in the tower and eat good.

<h4>Centennial Park </h4>
<!-- https://www.theodysseyonline.com/8-places-to-go-in-atlanta -->
<img src="travel_centennial_park.jpg" alt= "Centennial Park" style = "width:20%;">
<div> Centennial Park is a place you have to take your kids to when you come to Atlanta. Centennial park has so much history behind it. <thead>
        reason Centennial was build was because of the summer olympics. The summer olympic was hosted in Atlanta in 1996. Its located in downtown Atlanta.
        Its a fun place for kids because its a fountain ring that shoot out water and if you go at night time you see the water turns color. For the adults
        there's a park right next to the fountain ring, and a playground. They just built a ferries wheel near Centennial. The best place to stay when
        visting Atlanta is downtown. Its so much to do downtown, and theirs a lot of food resturants downtown. But your kids and you will emjoy a day
        at Centennial park.

<h4> Georgia Aquarium </h4>
